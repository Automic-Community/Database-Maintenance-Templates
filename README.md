<h1>DB Maintenace Templates for Windows</h1>
<h3>Regular maintenance of the Automic database is vital to the performance of the Automic system. <br /> Without regular maintenance, tables that hold data relating to the previously ran objects will continue to grow to an unmanageable size. The time it takes to return the results of a query against these tables will increase which in turn will impact the running of other statements.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>This plugin includes templates and configuration info for the following Utilities:</h3>
<ul>
<li>DB Archive</li>
<li>DB Reorg</li>
<li>DB Unload</li>
</ul>
